# Chocolate Problems - Step One

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Chocolate Problems series, focusing on the first step of analyzing a dataset of foreign chocolate shipments. The seller has provided a detailed list of specifications for each chocolate, and our objective is to explore and analyze these specifications to derive meaningful insights.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Inspecting the dataset and understanding key attributes.
- **Visualization**: Using graphs and plots to represent trends and distributions.
- **Statistical Insights**: Deriving important metrics about the shipment.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
